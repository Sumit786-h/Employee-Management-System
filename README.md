👨‍💼 Employee Management System

I built this Employee Management System to practice React and improve my front-end development skills.
It’s a lightweight dashboard where Admins can assign tasks and Employees can manage them with a clean UI and smooth workflow.
All data persists in localStorage — no backend required.

🚀 Features

Admin Panel — Create and assign tasks to employees.

Employee Dashboard — Accept, complete, fail, or archive tasks.

Task Status Flow — New → Active → Completed/Failed → Archive.

Interactive UI — Soft tinted task cards with hover effects and icons.

Local Persistence — Data survives page reloads.
